# Class Marks Dataset

## Project Overview
The **Class Marks Dataset** contains student examination scores across multiple subjects. This dataset can be useful for academic performance evaluation, trend analysis, and machine learning applications related to student performance prediction.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes student marks for various subjects along with their total scores.

### Columns in the Dataset:
- **Student ID (object/int64)**: Unique identifier for each student.
- **Student Name (object)**: Name of the student.
- **Subject 1 (int64)**: Marks obtained in the first subject.
- **Subject 2 (int64)**: Marks obtained in the second subject.
- **Subject 3 (int64)**: Marks obtained in the third subject.
- **...** (Additional subjects, if available)
- **Total Marks (int64)**: Sum of all subject scores for each student.
- **Percentage (float64)**: Total marks converted to a percentage.
- **Grade (object)**: Assigned grade based on the percentage.

### Insights from the Dataset:
- Identifies top-performing and struggling students.
- Analyzes trends in student performance across subjects.
- Helps in predicting final exam results based on class marks.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- **Academic Performance Analysis**: Evaluating student strengths and weaknesses.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicting grades or identifying at-risk students.
- **Education Research**: Understanding student performance trends over time.
