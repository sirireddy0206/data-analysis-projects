# Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview
The **Titanic Dataset** contains details about passengers aboard the Titanic, including survival status, personal details, and ticket information. This dataset is widely used for data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis.

## Dataset Description
The dataset provides passenger information, including demographic details, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

### Columns in the Dataset:
- **PassengerId (int64)**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived (int64)**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass (int64)**: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
- **Name (object)**: Passenger's name.
- **Sex (object)**: Gender (male/female).
- **Age (float64)**: Age in years.
- **SibSp (int64)**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch (int64)**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket (object)**: Ticket number.
- **Fare (float64)**: Ticket fare.
- **Cabin (object)**: Cabin number (if available).
- **Embarked (object)**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

### Insights from the Dataset:
- Survival rates varied based on passenger class and gender.
- Higher-class passengers had a greater chance of survival.
- Family presence may have influenced survival rates.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- **Machine Learning**: Building classification models to predict survival.
- **Data Visualization**: Analyzing survival rates across different demographics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding the impact of various factors on survival probability.
