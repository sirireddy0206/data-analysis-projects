# Car Price Dataset

## Project Overview
The **Car Price Dataset** contains information about used cars, including their specifications and resale prices. This dataset is useful for price prediction models, market analysis, and understanding factors that influence car pricing.

## Dataset Description
The dataset provides detailed attributes of used cars that affect their resale value.

### Columns in the Dataset:
- **Brand (object)**: The car manufacturer (e.g., Toyota, Ford, BMW, etc.).
- **Model (object)**: The specific model of the car.
- **Year (int64)**: The manufacturing year of the car.
- **Engine Size (float64)**: The engine capacity in liters.
- **Fuel Type (object)**: The type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric).
- **Transmission (object)**: The transmission type (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
- **Mileage (int64)**: The total distance the car has traveled (in kilometers or miles).
- **Doors (int64)**: The number of doors in the car.
- **Owner Count (int64)**: The number of previous owners.
- **Price (float64)**: The resale price of the car.

### Insights from the Dataset:
- Older models tend to have lower resale prices.
- Mileage and fuel type significantly impact pricing.
- Automatic and hybrid cars generally have higher values.
- Luxury brands retain value better than budget brands.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicting car resale values based on attributes.
- **Market Analysis**: Understanding trends in car pricing and demand.
- **Decision-Making**: Helping buyers and sellers determine fair car prices.
